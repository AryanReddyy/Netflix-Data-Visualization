Tasks Accomplished:
This is the project for the interaction module. This can be a team of 2 students or an individual project.

Dataset Used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows Links to an external site.

With any of our selected datasets, you or your team will build a visualization notebook or a python visualization project that contains the following.

1. Build upon one or multiple visualization methods, and achieve the 8 common basic interaction methods, select, explore, reconfigure, encode, abstract, elaborate, filter, connect. For each method, specify the type and justify briefly why this interaction completes the type. (8 points, 1 point each type). Refer to the slides of interaction.

2. Explore customized interaction with event handling -- interacting with figures, setup of event for your project, mouse enter, leave, object picking, keyboard. For each method, specify the type and justify briefly why this interaction completes the type.  (6 points, 1 point each type). Refer to the link: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/figure/index.html#Links to an external site.

3. An algorithm to enhance any of your interaction methods, such as a new method to show a unique statistical feature of the data. Refer to one example paper from our visualization and interaction papers. You can modify and simplify the method. Please describe the original and your method. (3 points) Here are suggestions with Python source codes or wrapper:

4. Explore combined interaction methods by applying all your basic interaction methods, such as exploring first, filtering second, reconfigure, â€¦, and etc. Demonstrate the best 3 insightful knowledge you have obtained with the combined interaction. This will be graded upon how the results will be useful by a domain user. You can specify your domain user, such as a wine specialist for the wine quality dataset, and show how the correlation of wine attributes can help specialists to achieve a task of their interests. (3 points)

Note:

a. You must use one of the provided datasets. You can add additional resources.
b. You can build upon your visualization project or switch to a new one, but stick to one dataset.
c. Team projects, submit names and roles of each student. One student can submit for the team.
d. Every code or resources from others, including internet or other students, must include a reference. If any plagiarism is found, this project will be graded as 0.


Additional Informatiom:

Some of the Visualization methods are not visible in the .html file as the data required to render is huge and unable to be captured.

All the cells in every notebook are running perfectly fine and producing the desired output without any errors while displaying data and handling.
